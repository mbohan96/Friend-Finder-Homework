Friend Finder Application

Description

Kardashian Friend Finder implements a match with a kardashian based on the user's responses to a ten question survey. The user responds to questions until done with the survey and then once all compelted they are match with a Kardashian.
This was implemented using a Node.js and Express server. 



There are still some bugs to be worked out with getting the matches to run and linking the pages but they will be fixed shortly. For now you can see a basic framework of how the app is to work within the code and any updates will be implemented ASAP
